CLIPS - A Tool for Building Expert Systems
==========================================

This repository contains a fork of CLIPS by

 Lode Hoste <lhoste@vub.ac.be> and Stefan Marr <Stefan.Marr@vub.ac.be>

The goal of this fork is to provide a CLIPS-derived rule engine that uses a
truly parallel RETE processing network that benefits from multi- and manycore
hardware to improve the overall performance of the matching phase.
